# Versioning


This library aims to adhere toÂ Semantic Versioning 2.0.0. As a summary, given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH:
MAJOR will increment when backwards-incompatible changes are introduced to the client. MINOR will increment when backwards-compatible functionality is added. PATCH will increment with backwards-compatible bug fixes. Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
Note: the client version does not necessarily reflect the version used in the AT&T M2X API.
